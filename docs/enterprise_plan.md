# Enterprise C-Suite Expansion Plan

This plan scales the OpenClaw enterprise by introducing specialized specialized AI "Executives" (sub-agents) to handle high-level corporate functions.

## New Specialized Divisions

### 1. Finance-Division (The CFO)
- **Skills**: `stock-analysis`, `stripe-api`, `agentmail`.
- **Primary Goal**: Monitor market opportunities and process payments/billing.

### 2. Creative-Division (The Creative Director)
- **Skills**: `ComfyUI-Runner`, `frontend-design`, `openai-image-gen`.
- **Primary Goal**: Generate logos, UI mockups, and marketing assets for new products.

### 3. Ops-Division (The COO)
- **Skills**: `notion`, `trello`, `Google-Calendar`, `apple-reminders`, `auto-updater`.
- **Primary Goal**: Synchronize tasks, manage schedules, and ensure system uptime/backups.

### 4. Support-Division (Customer Success)
- **Skills**: `voice-call`, `wacli` (WhatsApp), `humanizer`, `discord`.
- **Primary Goal**: Handle inbound inquiries, gather feedback, and engage with the community.

## Phase 3: Optimization & Enterprise Trust (High Probability of Success)

To move from "Experimental" to "Successful," the following advanced loops are added:

1. **Market Validation Loop**:
   - `Sales-Analyst` doesn't just find leads; it initiates a "Pre-Flight" check.
   - `Support-Division` sends an automated, humanized inquiry via LinkedIn/Email to verify if the requester has a budget and a clear timeline before `Dev-Division` starts work.

2. **The "Face" and Portfolio**:
   - `Creative-Division` & `Dev-Division` build an autonomous **Enterprise Portfolio Website**.
   - As projects are completed, the agent automatically adds "Case Studies" to this site (hosted on Fly.io) to build authority for future leads.

3. **Autonomous Post-Mortem (Self-Learning)**:
   - If a build fails or a lead is lost, the `CEO` agent uses the `oracle` skill to analyze the logs and update the `AGENTS.md` instructions for that division. This allows the enterprise to **evolve from its own mistakes**.

4. **Visual QA & Human-in-the-loop (HITL)**:
   - `Support-Division` acts as the final "Human Approval" gate (if enabled). It uses `Peekaboo` to take a screenshot of the final build and messages the USER (via Telegram/WhatsApp) with a "Ready to Ship?" prompt.

5. **Security Hardening**:
   - Every PR generated by `Dev-Division` must be scanned by a "Security Loop" using `clawdefender` to prevent credential leakage.

## Updated Core Workflow

1. **Discovery**: `Sales-Analyst` finds a lead.
2. **Consultation & Validation**: `Support-Division` verifies the lead's intent.
3. **Finance Pre-Check**: `Finance-Division` verifies market ROI.
4. **Product Design**: `Creative-Division` creates UI/Brand assets.
5. **Development & Visual QA**: `Dev-Division` builds; `Support-Division` visually verifies using Peekaboo.
6. **Deployment & Portfolio Update**: `Ops-Division` deploys and adds the project to the "Company Portfolio."
7. **Marketing & Growth**: `Marketing-Division` launches the content cycle on X/LinkedIn/HN.

## Execution Steps

1. **Agent Registration**: Create workspaces and register the 4 new sub-agents.
2. **CEO Logic Update**: Update `HEARTBEAT.md` with the full C-Suite orchestration directives.
3. **Metabolism Boot**: Restart the daemon to pick up the new structure.

## Verification
- Successful execution of `openclaw agents list` showing 7+ agents.
- Presence of tasks in the specialized workspaces.
- Cross-agent communication detected in `gateway.log`.
