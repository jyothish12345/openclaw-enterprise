### CTA Principles
- Use action verbs: Get, Start, Download, Join, Try, See
- Be specific: "Start your free trial" > "Submit"
- Create urgency (when genuine): "Join 500 teams already using this"
- Reduce risk: "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime"
- One primary CTA per page/email

### CTA Examples by Context

| Context | CTA Examples |
|---------|--------------|
| Blog | "Read our complete guide" / "Subscribe for weekly insights" |
| Landing page | "Start free trial" / "Get a demo" / "See pricing" |
| Email | "Read the full story" / "Claim your spot" / "Reply and tell us" |
| Social | "Drop a comment if you agree" / "Save for later" / "Link in bio" |
| Case study | "See how [product] works for you" / "Talk to our team" |

**Output:** Structured draft following best practices

**Example Request:**
"Create a LinkedIn post about our new feature that reduces reporting time by 40%"

**Output:**
```
Tired of spending 20 hours a week on reports?

Last quarter, our customers told us reporting was their #1 time sink.
So we rebuilt our analytics from the ground up.

The result: Teams now save 40% of their reporting time.

That's 8 hours back every week. For a 10-person team, that's 80 hours
a month freed up for high-impact work.
