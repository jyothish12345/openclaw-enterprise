# Response Drafting (OpenClaw Adapted)

Draft professional, empathetic, and effective customer-facing communications. Adapt tone, structure, and content based on the situation, relationship stage, and communication channel.

## When to Use
- Responding to customer support tickets
- Escalations or urgent issues
- Outage notifications
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Billing or account inquiries
- Any customer-facing communication

## Trigger Phrases
- "Draft response to this customer"
- "Help me respond to this ticket"
- "Write customer response"
- "How should I reply to this"

## Core Principles

1. **Lead with empathy** — Acknowledge the customer's situation first
2. **Be direct** — Get to the point (bottom-line-up-front)
3. **Be honest** — Never overpromise, never mislead
4. **Be specific** — Use concrete details, timelines, and names
5. **Own it** — Take responsibility ("We" not "the system")
6. **Close the loop** — Every response needs a clear next step
7. **Match their energy** — If frustrated, be empathetic first

## Response Structure

```
1. Acknowledgment / Context (1-2 sentences)
   - Acknowledge what they said or are experiencing
   - Show you understand their situation

2. Core Message (1-3 paragraphs)
   - Deliver the main information or answer
   - Be specific and concrete
   - Include relevant details

3. Next Steps (1-3 bullets)
   - What YOU will do and by when
   - What THEY need to do (if anything)
   - When they'll hear from you next

4. Closing (1 sentence)
   - Warm but professional sign-off
   - Reinforce you're available
```

## Length Guidelines

| Channel | Length | Style |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Chat/IM | 1-4 sentences | Get to the point immediately |
| Support ticket | 1-3 short paragraphs | Structured and scannable |
| Email | 3-5 paragraphs max | Respect their inbox |
| Escalation | As long as needed | Well-structured with headers |
| Executive comms | 2-3 paragraphs max | Data-driven, shorter is better |

## Tone Guidelines

| Situation | Tone | Characteristics |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Good news / wins | Celebratory | Enthusiastic, warm, forward-looking |
| Routine update | Professional | Clear, concise, informative, friendly |
| Technical response | Precise | Accurate, detailed, structured, patient |
| Delayed delivery | Accountable | Honest, apologetic, action-oriented |
| Bad news | Candid | Direct, empathetic, solution-oriented |
| Issue / outage | Urgent | Immediate, transparent, actionable |
| Escalation | Executive | Composed, ownership-taking, confident |
| Billing / account | Precise | Clear, factual, empathetic |

## Tone by Relationship Stage

**New Customer (0-3 months):**
- More formal and professional
- Extra context and explanation
- Proactively offer help and resources
- Build trust through reliability

**Established Customer (3+ months):**
- Warm and collaborative
- Reference shared history
- More direct and efficient
- Show awareness of their goals

**Frustrated/Escalated Customer:**
- Extra empathy and acknowledgment
- Urgency in response times
- Concrete action plans with specific commitments
- Shorter feedback loops

## Writing Style Rules

**DO:**
- Use active voice ("We'll investigate" not "This will be investigated")
- Use "I" for personal commitments, "we" for team commitments
- Name specific people when assigning actions
- Use the customer's terminology, not internal jargon
- Include specific dates/times ("by Friday Jan 24" not "in a few days")
- Break up long responses with headers or bullets

**DON'T:**
- Use corporate jargon ("synergy", "leverage", "paradigm shift")
- Deflect blame to other teams or systems
- Use passive voice to avoid ownership ("Mistakes were made")
- Include unnecessary caveats that undermine confidence
- Use exclamation marks excessively (one per email max)

## Response Templates

Hi [Name],

Thank you for reporting this — I can see how [specific impact]
would be frustrating for your team.

I've confirmed the issue and escalated it to our engineering team
as a [priority level]. Here's what we know so far:
- [What's happening]
- [What's causing it, if known]
- [Workaround, if available]

I'll update you by [specific date/time] with a resolution timeline.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Let me know if you have any
questions about your account.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Feature Request (Won't Build)

```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for sharing this request — I can see why [capability]
would be valuable for [their use case].

I discussed this with our product team, and this isn't something
we're planning to build in the near term. The primary reason is
[honest, respectful explanation].

That said, I want to make sure you can accomplish your goal.
Here are some alternatives:
- [Alternative approach 1]
- [Alternative approach 2]
- [Integration or workaround if applicable]

I've also documented your request in our feedback system, and if
our direction changes, I'll let you know.

Would any of these alternatives work for your team? Happy to dig
deeper into any of them.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Outage/Incident Communication

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out directly to let you know about an issue
affecting [service/feature] that I know your team relies on.

**What happened:** [Clear, non-technical explanation]
**Impact:** [How it affects them specifically]
**Status:** [Current status — investigating / fixing / resolved]
**ETA for resolution:** [Specific time or update cadence]

[If applicable: "In the meantime, you can [workaround]."]

I'm personally tracking this and will update you as soon as we
have a resolution. You can also check [status page URL] for
real-time updates.

I'm sorry for the disruption to your team's work. We take this
seriously and [what you're doing to prevent recurrence].

### Following Up After Silence

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to check in — I sent over [what you sent] on [date] and
wanted to make sure it didn't get lost in the shuffle.

[Brief reminder of what you need from them or what you're offering]

If now isn't a good time, no worries — just let me know when would
be better, and I'm happy to reconnect then.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Follow-up Cadence

| Situation | Follow-up Timing |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Unanswered question | 2-3 business days |
| Open critical issue | Daily until resolved |
| Open standard issue | Every 2-3 days |
| Post-meeting action items | Within 24 hours, then at deadline |
| After bad news | 1 week to check impact |

## When to Escalate

**Escalate to manager when:**
- Customer threatens to cancel or significantly downsell
- Customer requests policy exception you can't authorize
- Issue unresolved longer than SLA allows
- Customer requests direct contact with leadership
- You've made an error needing senior involvement

**Escalate to product/engineering when:**
- Bug is critical and blocking customer's business
- Feature gap is causing a competitive loss
- Customer has unique technical requirements
- Integration issues require engineering investigation

**Escalation format:**
```
ESCALATION: [Customer Name] — [One-line summary]

Urgency: [Critical / High / Medium]
Customer impact: [What's broken for them]
History: [Brief background — 2-3 sentences]
What I've tried: [Actions taken so far]
